**Tip**: You can hold down the `ENTER` button of the M5StickV, Maix Amigo or WonderMV to turn on their LED light to potentially increase visibility. All cameras have an anti-glare mode, use it to capture images from high brightness screens or with incident light. Enable/disable anti-glare by pressing `PAGE` button while scanning.

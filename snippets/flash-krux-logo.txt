When the flashing process completes, you should see the Krux logo:

<img src="/krux/img/maixpy_amigo/logo-300.png" class="amigo">
<img src="/krux/img/maixpy_m5stickv/logo-250.png" class="m5stickv">

If it doesn't, try turning your device off and on by holding down the power button for six seconds.

Congrats, you're now running Krux!
